## TODO
* Duolingo - https://www.duolingo.com/profile/ChristopherH757 doesn't work for me
* regroup links
* icons (maybe after hugo)
* more StackExchange profiles
* switch to hugo
* try dagger
* retroblogging
* implement linting of Markdown, etc. in GHA

### Possibilities
* link to Amazon profile
* bricklink when it is working again
* use github issues instead of a text file for tracking site todo items
* calendar view
* calendly
* geolocation
* game character links
