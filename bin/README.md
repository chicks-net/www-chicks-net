Scripts for processing random social media archives into the current blog format.

- [linkedin](./linkedin) is what I used to relaunch the site with Hugo, but it
  is pretty rough around the edges.  I'm hoping to clean it up or rewrite it in
  a language with less of a stigma.
- See [google-plus-posts-dumper](https://github.com/chicks-net/google-plus-posts-dumper)
  for turning google+ posts into hugo-friendly Markdown.  See #198 for when
  those posts got merged into this repo / the web site.

Other random scripts have been tossed in here too:

- [create-github-issues.sh](create-github-issues.sh) created a bunch of issues
  so that we didn't keep editing the `/TODO.md` file. This was saved for
  posterity - don't run it again.  It will recreate a bunch of issues.  That's
  also why most of it is still commented out.  You can see what ran on the
  last day.
