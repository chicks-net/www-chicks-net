So here is a translation with some minor improvements I hope to make the life easier for the English speakers that want to keep the zombies out of the house.\nIntroduction I wanted to get all of the Steam Achievements myself and the only convenient guide I could find was in French. So here is a translation with some minor improvements I hope to make the life easier for the English speakers that want to keep the zombies out of the house.\nSort Order The biggest improvement in my translation is sorting things from easiest to hardest. My metric for difficulty is the percentage of achievement completion on Steam. This number is in italics in front of the description of each achievement below. I expect these numbers to change through time, but over the last few months they have been completely stable. The main negative of this sort order is that trivial achievements like Ask Me About Mustache Mode is lower in the list than Home Lawn Security which requires beating the game.\nAcknowledgements Thanks to Célestine Alys for a fabulous French achievements guide which was the only complete collection of PvZ achievements I could find.\nSPUDOW! 75% Blow up a zombie using a potato mine Success is very simple, you just need to blow up any zombie with a potato mine. It costs only 25 suns and kills a zombie in one shot.\nExplodonator 60% Blow up 10 zombies with a single cherry bomb Wait for the difficulty to increase and with it the number of zombies, because at the beginning of the game it is almost impossible to find 10 zombies at once. The survival mode is another way to unlock this achievement.\nPenny Pincher 47% Pick up 30 coins in a row on a single level without letting any disappear. This achievement is quite simple. Indeed coins appear often enough and it will be easy to recover 30 in a level, without missing any. Get a few plants in your Zen Garden and this shouldn’t take long.\nDisco is undead 43% Hypnotize the lead dancer zombie For success you need to hypnotize a Dancing Zombie with the Hypno-shroom. The main problem you will encounter is that the Dancing Zombie invokes other zombies that are placed before him and those zombies eat your Hypno-shroom instead of the leader. One way to deal with this is to wait for the subzombies to spawn and then put the hypnoshroom in between them.\nHome Lawn Security 41% Complete Adventure Mode You must complete the main mode of play (aka adventure mode), essentially finish all levels including level 5-10.\nRoll Some Heads 34% Bowl over 5 zombies with a single Wall-Nut For success you need to play a level of bowling and you need to touch (not necessarily kill) 5 zombies in one throw. The more zombies the easier it will be\nMorticulturalist 18% Collect all 49 plants The 49 plants are those unlocked via the adventure mode. Add to that the improvement of some plants to buy from Crazy Dave and don’t forget the Imitater : the plant that allows you to pick the same plant twice on one level to get two cool downs.\nAsk Me About Mustache Mode 18% Enable Mustache Mode Nothing more simple: during a game, type out on your keyboard the word “mustache”, you will unlock success and all the zombies will have mustaches! (Also try “future”)\nDo not Pea in the Pool 17% Complete a daytime pool level without using pea shooters An easy success, replace shooters with basic pea catapults, they cost the same number of suns and do the same damage.\nBeyond the Grave 15% Beat all 20 mini games The mini-games are unlocked at some point in the adventure mode and then as you succeed in those mini-games you unlock the rest. Some suggestions for some of the harder mini-games are:\nLast Stand -- As suggested by another game guide you can do this with a first row of Tall-nuts followed by a row of Torchwoods backed by at least a row of Repeaters. The Magnet-Shrooms are not needed if you have two rows of Repeaters as seen in this youtube video.\nBobsled Bonanza -- Wikia has a few suggestions. I like #8 - The Starfruit method.\nZomBotany 2 -- Wikia again\nPogo Party -- recently discussed on Arqade\nThere is a bug where it may not give you the achievement after you have beaten all 20 mini-games. I was able to work around this on MacOS by creating a new profile in-game. I did not have to replay anything.\nSunny Days 14% Get 8000 sun during a single level. In a single level your sunshine meter must display the number 8000. A very simple technicality will help you gain this achievement: playing a game of Zombiequarium (in mini-games) and reap your 8000 suns! Be patient, however one should not buy the trophy of victory for 1000 suns or the game ends.\nNobel Peas Prize 14% Get the golden sunflower trophy For this achievement, you must complete the adventure mode at least once and win 20 trophies in mini-games, 18 in Puzzle Mode and 10 in Survival Mode.\nCryptozombologist 13% Discover the top secret zombie To find this zombie you need to have already completed the adventure mode once and repeat it to reach level 4-10 where the mysterious zombie will be. Don’t blink.\nNo Fungus Among Us 11% Complete a nighttime level without planting any mushrooms. Success is a little easier than Good Morning. Choose still a short and simple level. Sun production suns will be slower but you should be able to work this out.\nTowering Wisdom 10% Grow the Tree of Wisdom to 100 feet You have to buy the tree for $10,000 then you have to feed it with 100 packages of fertilizers (those $2,500 each). Dave offers 5 when you buy the tree, so you will spend the remaining $237,500! At 50ft you still need $125,000 for 50 more fertilizers, but at least it will show the height as number at that point. For farming money play endless survival mode and raise the plants in the Zen Garden.\nGrounded 9% Defeat a normal roof level without using Any catapult plants To succeed you will need to use conventional pea launchers (peashooter), but so that they can reach the zombies, that is to say not at the bottom but advanced to the zombies. Defend yourself well with Wall-Nut and use bombs and mines!\nImmortal 9% Get to 20 flags in Survival Endless Like the China Shop and Better Off Dead achievements you need to unlock the Endless mode by completing all of the previous levels. Surviving 20 waves means you must successfully pass 20 flags that announce the arrival of a wave of zombies. You see those flags in the rising standard bar at the bottom right. There are 2 flags by level so you have to complete 10 levels of increasing difficulty. Good luck.\nGood Morning 9% Complete a daytime level by planting only Mushrooms and Coffee Beans Success is a little complicated, so choose a short and simple level, like the first level Survival mode. Please do pick mushrooms and coffee beans to wake these fungi and no sunflowers.\nPopcorn Party 9% Defeat 2 Gargantuars with Corn Cob missiles in a single level The gargantuars are zombies and giant corn cob missiles projectiles sent by the merger of two catapults through improved corn. These missiles are great except that they are one shot only. If you want a backup plan then you need two more catapults and another improvement to make a missile launcher. To achieve this successfully play survival mode and wait for gargantuars arrive (sometimes 2 or 3 together in hard mode) and focus your missiles on them! Success is realised as soon as the two are dead and not to the end of the level.\nChina Shop 6% Get to a streak of 15 in Endless Vasebreaker You must complete all levels of the Vasebreaker mode to unlock the Endless Mode. Take your time. Think before playing and breaking vases. Start with the rightmost possible in order to anticipate the progression of zombies. As you clear the rightmost column fill it with the left-firing peashooters. The zombie that goes boom will wipe out your guns so clear out two rows before placing your right-side guns if you can.\nBetter Off Dead 6% Get to a streak of 10 in I, Zombie Endless You need to unlock the mode without end finish all the levels I, Zombie. Then you’re going to win 10 games in a row. Your suns persist from one party to another, so save up and think carefully before you play because you have the time.\nGuide ChangeLog v0.1 2015-2-22 - first draft v0.3 2015-7-10 - added tips for specific mini-games v0.4 2015-8-17 - add link to Pogo Party tips and mention Zen Garden for Penny Pincher Conversion metadata --- game_id: 3590 game_title: 'Plants vs. Zombies: Game of the Year' guide_id: 396162375 guide_title: 'Plants vs Zombies: All Achievements Guide' authors: - '76561198037662755' post_date: '2015-02-22' update_date: '2015-08-17' category: - Achievements - Secrets rating: 5 num_ratings: 553 unique_visitors: 16101 current_favorites: 573 comments: 46 --- ",

<h2 id="sort-order">Sort Order<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#sort-order">#</a></h2>
<p>The biggest improvement in my translation is sorting things from easiest to
hardest. My metric for difficulty is the percentage of achievement completion
on Steam. This number is in italics in front of the description of each
achievement below. I expect these numbers to change through time, but over the
last few months they have been completely stable. The main negative of this
sort order is that trivial achievements like <strong>Ask Me About Mustache Mode</strong> is
lower in the list than <strong>Home Lawn Security</strong> which requires beating the game.</p>

<strong><em>Blow up a zombie using a potato mine</em></strong> Success is very simple, you just
need to blow up any zombie with a potato mine. It costs only 25 suns and kills
a zombie in one shot.</p>

<em>60%</em> <em><strong>Blow up 10 zombies with a single cherry bomb</strong></em> Wait for the
difficulty to increase and with it the number of zombies, because at the
beginning of the game it is almost impossible to find 10 zombies at once. The
survival mode is another way to unlock this achievement.</p>

<em>47%</em> <em><strong>Pick up 30 coins in a row on a single level without letting any
disappear.</strong></em> This achievement is quite simple. Indeed coins appear often
enough and it will be easy to recover 30 in a level, without missing any. Get a
few plants in your Zen Garden and this shouldn&rsquo;t take long.</p>

<em>43%</em> <strong><em>Hypnotize the lead dancer zombie</em></strong> For success you need to hypnotize
a Dancing Zombie with the Hypno-shroom. The main problem you will encounter is
that the Dancing Zombie invokes other zombies that are placed before him and
those zombies eat your Hypno-shroom instead of the leader. One way to deal with
this is to wait for the subzombies to spawn and then put the hypnoshroom in
between them.</p>

zombies will have mustaches! (Also try &ldquo;future&rdquo;)</p>

success, replace shooters with basic pea catapults, they cost the same number
of suns and do the same damage.</p>

<em>15%</em> <em><strong>Beat all 20 mini games</strong></em> The mini-games are unlocked at some point in
the adventure mode and then as you succeed in those mini-games you unlock the
rest. Some suggestions for some of the harder mini-games are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Last Stand</strong> -- As suggested by <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=124147156">another game guide</a> you can do this with a first row of Tall-nuts followed by a row of Torchwoods backed by at least a row of Repeaters. The Magnet-Shrooms are not needed if you have two rows of Repeaters as seen in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_gMP6YaMx8">this youtube video</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bobsled Bonanza</strong> -- <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fplantsvszombies.wikia.com%2Fwiki%2FBobsled_Bonanza%2FStrategies">Wikia</a> has a few suggestions. I like #8 - The Starfruit method.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>ZomBotany 2</strong> -- <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fplantsvszombies.wikia.com%2Fwiki%2FZomBotany_2%2FStrategies">Wikia</a> again</p>
</li>

<p><strong>Pogo Party</strong> -- <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgaming.stackexchange.com%2Fquestions%2F229065%2Fhow-do-i-beat-the-pogo-party-minigame">recently discussed on Arqade</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a <em>bug</em> where it may not give you the achievement after you have
beaten all 20 mini-games. I was able to work around this on MacOS by creating a
new profile in-game. I did not have to replay anything.</p>

<em>14%</em> <em><strong>Get 8000 sun during a single level.</strong></em> In a single level your sunshine
meter must display the number 8000. A very simple technicality will help you
gain this achievement: playing a game of <strong>Zombiequarium</strong> (in mini-games) and
reap your 8000 suns! Be patient, however one should <em>not buy the trophy</em> of
victory for 1000 suns or the game ends.</p>

<em>14%</em> <em><strong>Get the golden sunflower trophy</strong></em> For this achievement, you must
complete the adventure mode at least once and win 20 trophies in mini-games, 18
in Puzzle Mode and 10 in Survival Mode.</p>

<em>13%</em> <strong><em>Discover the top secret zombie</em></strong> To find this zombie you need to have
already completed the adventure mode once and repeat it to reach level <strong>4-10</strong>
where the mysterious zombie will be. <em>Don&rsquo;t blink.</em></p>

<em>11%</em> <strong><em>Complete a nighttime level without planting any mushrooms.</em></strong> Success
is a little easier than <em>Good Morning</em>. Choose still a short and simple level.
Sun production suns will be slower but you should be able to work this out.</p>

<em>10%</em> <em><strong>Grow the Tree of Wisdom to 100 feet</strong></em> You have to buy the tree for
$10,000 then you have to feed it with 100 packages of fertilizers (those $2,500
each). Dave offers 5 when you buy the tree, so you will spend the remaining
$237,500! At 50ft you still need $125,000 for 50 more fertilizers, but at least
it will show the height as number at that point. For farming money play endless
survival mode and raise the plants in the <em>Zen Garden</em>.</p>

<em>9%</em> <strong><em>Defeat a normal roof level without using Any catapult plants</em></strong> To
succeed you will need to use conventional pea launchers (peashooter), but so
that they can reach the zombies, that is to say not at the bottom but advanced
to the zombies. Defend yourself well with Wall-Nut and use bombs and mines!</p>
<h3 id="immortal">Immortal<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#immortal">#</a></h3>

<em>9%</em> <strong><em>Get to 20 flags in Survival Endless</em></strong> Like the <em>China Shop</em> and
<em>Better Off Dead</em> achievements you need to unlock the Endless mode by
completing all of the previous levels. Surviving 20 waves means you must
successfully pass 20 flags that announce the arrival of a wave of zombies. You
see those flags in the rising standard bar at the bottom right. There are 2
flags by level so you have to complete 10 levels of increasing difficulty.
<em>Good luck.</em></p>

<em>9%</em> <strong><em>Complete a daytime level by planting only Mushrooms and Coffee Beans</em></strong>
Success is a little complicated, so choose a short and simple level, like the
first level Survival mode. Please do pick mushrooms and coffee beans to wake
these fungi and <em>no sunflowers</em>.</p>

<em>9%</em> <strong><em>Defeat 2 Gargantuars with Corn Cob missiles in a single level</em></strong> The
gargantuars are zombies and giant corn cob missiles projectiles sent by the
merger of two catapults through improved corn. These missiles are great except
that they are <em>one shot only</em>. If you want a backup plan then you need two more
catapults and another improvement to make a missile launcher. To achieve this
successfully play survival mode and wait for gargantuars arrive (sometimes 2 or
3 together in hard mode) and focus your missiles on them! Success is realised
as soon as the two are dead and not to the end of the level.</p>

<em>6%</em> <strong><em>Get to a streak of 15 in Endless Vasebreaker</em></strong> You must complete all
levels of the Vasebreaker mode to unlock the Endless Mode. Take your time.
Think before playing and breaking vases. Start with the rightmost possible in
order to anticipate the progression of zombies. As you clear the rightmost
column fill it with the left-firing peashooters. The zombie that goes boom will
wipe out your guns so clear out two rows before placing your right-side guns if
you can.</p>

<em>6%</em> <em><strong>Get to a streak of 10 in I, Zombie Endless</strong></em> You need to unlock the
mode without end finish all the levels I, Zombie. Then you&rsquo;re going to win 10
games in a row. Your suns persist from one party to another, so save up and
think carefully before you play because you have the time.</p>
