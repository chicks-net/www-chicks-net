      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like many, I’ve usually kept my charitable giving private — and I’ve respected
that choice in others.  But recently, a few people have asked where they might
consider donating. Since I don’t see a need to keep it to myself, I’ll share my
recommendations for anyone interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve organized this around a few themes.  For each one I will link to the
organization’s website and the Charity Navigator rating.  For all of the
organizations mentioned below, I respect them and I have personally donated to
them at least once, but often over several years.  I’m leaving out
organizations that I don’t want to donate to for various reasons and local
charities, but I may revisit those topics someday.  I’m also not including much
commentary on each one since I’m hoping you will find your own reasons to like
them and contribute.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
