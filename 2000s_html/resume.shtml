		<P> I have been the primary software developer on the
			following software projects:
		<UL>
			<LI> <B>National Weather Service Advanced Hydrologic Prediction Services:</b> 
				I was brought in to manage the servers that were running
				AHPS for the NWS Eastern Region.  Since then I have completely rewritten the web
				front end and created a web-based management tool that
				users in Weather Forecast Offices (WFO's) use to manage
				the data that appears on the web.  My work is now being used
				nationally exclusively.  This work included
				significant amounts of parsing to translate text files
				into a database, GIS work to dynamically create maps,
				data analysis work to produce meaningful graphs, using LDAP
				for authentication, email notification of changes and general
				web development.  The publicly visible
				portion of this can be seen starting with the
				<A href="http://www.crh.noaa.gov/ahps/about.php">Weather.Gov
				Rivers Tab</a>.  A demo of the configuration interface
				used by the WFO's is available upon
				 <A href="mailto:chicks@chicks.net?subject=AHPS%20Conf%20Access%20Request">request</a>.
			<LI> <B>iReserve:</b> 
				I am the lead developer on a web
				service for managing insurance claims.
				The site provides a web interface,
				a SOAP interface, and a SQL interface.
				Native clients utilizing the SOAP
				interface are in development.
				The web site produces custom reports
				in HTML, PDF, and Microsoft Excel
				instantly.  This was developed
				on Red Hat and Fedora Core Linux utilizing
				MySQL 4.0, Apache 2.0, mod_perl 2.0,
				and Perl 5.8.
				A demo is available
				<a href="https://demo.ireserve.info/">online</a>.

			<LI> <B>DAR:</b> 
				I created
				a database to support buying and
				selling of components.
				I analyzed the input data, designed
				the database, built the database server,
				built the user interface, and processed
				the many initial inputs into the database.
				The front-end was based on Java and HTML forms.
				Approximately 40 gigabytes of input
				data was processed using perl and SQL
				into 8 gigabytes of data in the
				relational database.
				This was developed using Red Hat
				Commercial Linux 5.0 and mysql 3.21.
				
			<LI> <B>Virginia Department of Health:</b>
				An Oracle database was created to
				manage children's Medicare records.  
				The system increased operator efficiency,
				reduced input errors, and handled
				communications with the state's
				purchase order system and Federal
				reporting requirements.  I managed
				several programmers and handled
				Data Base Administration on Oracle 6
				and 7 as well as UNIX system
				administration on an NCR UNIX system.

			<LI> <B>Challenger Business Systems:</b> 
				A serial-based middleware product in
				MS-Windows and four different versions
				of UNIX was created.
				It multiplexed data from
				multiple electronic parts catalogs
				to a dealer business system.
				This required systems-level programming
				under HP-UX, Xenix, SCO UNIX, and TI1500
				System V.  The client program included
				a rather complete terminal emulator.
