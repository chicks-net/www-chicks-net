This table shows the relationships between Linux kernel versions included in Debian releases and their corresponding Ubuntu and Linux Mint versions. When Ubuntu or Mint skipped a release, the Debian version is still included.

## Notes

- **Debian** releases are the foundation, with Ubuntu built on Debian and Mint typically built on Ubuntu
- **Ubuntu LTS** releases occur every 2 years and are based on the current Debian stable release
- **Linux Mint** follows Ubuntu LTS releases, typically releasing 1-3 months after the corresponding Ubuntu LTS
- **LMDE** (Linux Mint Debian Edition) is based directly on Debian and follows a separate release schedule
- Early Ubuntu and Mint releases don't align perfectly with this matrix due to different development timelines
- Some intermediate Ubuntu releases (non-LTS) and Mint releases are not shown for clarity
