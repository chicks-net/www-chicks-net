I am Christopher Hicks. I\'m the Founder/CTO/bottle washer of [Flamingo
Internet Navigators](https://www.fini.net/) (aka FINI aka fini.net). You
can find my latest work exploits on my [Linked-In
profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chicks2fini).

### Why \"chicks\"?

Because it\'s my name!

Take the first letter of my first name and put all of my last name right
after it and there ya go. This is in fact exactly what
[MCV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VCU_School_of_Medicine) did when
they gave me my first account on a real computer - their VAX cluster
known as `gems`. After getting over the initial volume of retribution
from my fellow geeks I\'ve grown quite fond of it.

So, a few years later I\'m administering a box on the net and I decide
to register chicks.net. Those were the days when you just sent an e-mail
and \"it was done\". No money, no grief, but you might have to wait a
few weeks. Oh, and if your DNS wasn\'t working right they didn\'t
include you in the zone files. Those were the days! :)
