These long trains are
[preventing Amtrak trains from getting through on time](https://www.trains.com/trn/news-reviews/news-wire/fight-over-freight-delays-could-hit-amtraks-wallet-analysis/).
We only sat behind it for 3 minutes, but we couldn't even see the start of the train in the distance.

Thanks to all of the graffiti artists who keep our coal trains looking so much
less boring than they otherwise would.
