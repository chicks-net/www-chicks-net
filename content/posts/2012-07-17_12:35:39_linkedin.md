Why does spam get archived in hours?

Repeatedly across numerous groups I try to flag spam in Linked-In groups and I
find that the message is already archived.  I only found out about these posts
because of the daily Linked-In emails, so these posts are being archived in less
than a day, often in single digit hours.  How could this be?

The link associated with this post was meant to be an example, but the message
board post is
[http://www.linkedin.com/groupAnswers?viewQuestionAndAnswers=&discussionID=134866365&gid=1268377&trk=eml-anet_dig-b_nd-pst_ttle-cn&ut=0WocEMpkIQr5k1](http://www.linkedin.com/groupAnswers?viewQuestionAndAnswers=&discussionID=134866365&gid=1268377&trk=eml-anet_dig-b_nd-pst_ttle-cn&ut=0WocEMpkIQr5k1)

I've tried pursuing this with Linked-In technical support.  I opened and
reopened and reopened tickets with them.  And their answer over and over again
is to go to the group leader.  Well, either the group leaders are all complicit
in this spamming, or this is a bug completely out of their control.  I'd much
prefer to believe the bug option but I have not been able to get a group leader
concerned enough about this to get anywhere.

Has anyone else experienced this?  Do anyone know how to get Linked-In to pay
attention?  Or should I just give up and go find another technical discussion
community?
