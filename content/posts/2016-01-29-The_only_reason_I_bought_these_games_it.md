... I'm mixed on this. On one hand, I can see his point: had he known it was going to be so much more work, he wouldnt' have done it in the first place.  But on the other hand, if you're going to choose to support an additional platform... then support it all the way.I played Rust and it's one of the few games where I thought, "nice open ended game!" but seriously, Linux does get the short end of things when it comes to GPU support, game engine support, and testing coverage.I would counter the whole 1% platform argument with this: you are trying to break into segments of the market. Just because you flipped the sign to "open" for Linux, doesn't mean people will suddenly jump on board... especially since it costs real money and it's a gamble. (Anyone remember Loki Games?) It's the job of the platform/engine/developer to strike out and market to the people to pull in more users.This "well, they didn't all come and jump on the band wagon, so why bother spending resources to test it" line of thinking is why it isn't successful. arg Sorry, SO much frustration when it comes to Linux and gaming that goes back to the '90s. Yeah, I bought Rust as well. It was seriously the only reason why I joined Steam. (Thank goodness for those Kickstarters that released their games on multiple platforms through Steam, otherwise, it would have been a complete waste).

+Christopher Hicks side note, don't get me wrong. SERIOUS kudos to Gary Newman for making the choice to port to Linux.  And it sucks he's getting alot of complaints. But just wanted to point out that there is definitely a cultural memory that responds to  issues like this with a "not again" feeling.

I sympathize with both sides but I wanted my main message to stay positive.
