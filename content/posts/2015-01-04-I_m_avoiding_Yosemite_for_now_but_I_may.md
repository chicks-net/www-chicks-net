Not sure if you noticed, but this is written by a Geoff Wozniak, not The Woz.
Nonetheless,  this article was spot on with my feelings on the matter.But OSX
for games...I tried to sell myself on that fiction once.  Windows is a
necessary evil for the time being.

Still using Yosemite. I agree with several points regarding certain
unpredictability and bugs/"features" in the latest releases. I have a dislike
for hfs+ and the case sensitive or not non-sense. However, while things in the
command line space can most likely be happier with a Linux environment, the
desktop/gui side is less of a struggle for me.Avoiding dependence hell is also
a nice thing for a desktop.But yeah, yosemite was a huge pita to upgrade to. :(
the dir merge sucked.
