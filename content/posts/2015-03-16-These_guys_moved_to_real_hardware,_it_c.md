Flexibility is expensive. Every feature has a cost. If you don't need it, then you pay the cost without any benefit.That's sort if the philosophy I strive towards with software and it is 100% true with infrastructure as well.If you understand your problem well then flexibility just isn't worth the cost. However, if you don't understand your problem then flexibility can be a game changer.
