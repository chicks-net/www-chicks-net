It was fun to feed the Lorakeets at
[Busch Gardens Williamsburg](https://buschgardens.com/williamsburg/)
this week.  We kept missing them by a few minutes so we were so glad
that we got to make it in finally.

I tried the Merlin app in there, but it only detected the American Robin.
I'm not sure if it ignored the exotic birds because they don't belong
in Virginia.
