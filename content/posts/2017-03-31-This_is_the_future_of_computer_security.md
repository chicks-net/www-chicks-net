What is this nonsense? I use amavisd-new and CSF LFD on Ubuntu, like the guy
asking, so I answer what worked for me. And then you trigger-happy rate it with
a minus? Now that's motivational! NOT. This reminds me why wikipedia and
stackexchange will never get any donations from me.

sorry about your motivation.
