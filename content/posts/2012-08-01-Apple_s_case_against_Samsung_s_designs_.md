Apple's case against Samsung's designs strains any rational consideration.  Shocker!  Apple lives in its own reality.  Being a strong innovator is not enough for them.  They have to rewrite history and then sue people over it.  What a sad farce.  Maybe if they weren't putting so much energy into the court room they'd have more mojo for competing with Android.  Siri, why why why?
