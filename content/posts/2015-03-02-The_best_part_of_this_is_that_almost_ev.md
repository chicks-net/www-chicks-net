The best part of this is that almost every country thinks they are the least
arrogant and most compassionate.

Somehow the Italians realize they are not the least arrogant, plus in a fit of
fabulous self-realization Italians see themselves as the least trustworthy!  So
go to #italy because they are so passionate, but stay because they stole your
wallet.

Kudos to the fabulous writers and table makers at +The Economist.  They are the
/New Yorker/ of news IMHO.

I like how France sees themselves as both the most and the least arrogant.

Good point Peter.  The French must be really keen on hedges.

When asked if they wanted to take a survey they said "We've already got one!"

How much has changed in 65 years.I read something recently, but I can't recall
where, about the innumerable economic benefits to the German and Japanese
economies created by the allies preventing them from building up armed forces
post WWII.  It completely liberated those countries to focus all of their
energy and resources on other aspects of their economy.

I'm with you Paul.  It makes me wonder what 'merica could do without
outspending the whole rest of the world on guns.
