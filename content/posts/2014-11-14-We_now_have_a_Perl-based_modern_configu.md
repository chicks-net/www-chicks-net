Isn't rex the name of a mainframe command line pipe tool?

Actually that was rexx and it also ran in OS/2, but what can you do?  There are so many confusing names in the computer business.

Ah! Rexx! I think someone ported Rexx a while back. Yeah, computers and all the odd names. :)

There's a foreman in heroku that is not the foreman used for deploying servers.  There is slack the configuration management system or slack the instant messaging app.  Don't get me started on how many different things "entity" and "relationship" mean, and how different camps can't agree on which is which.
