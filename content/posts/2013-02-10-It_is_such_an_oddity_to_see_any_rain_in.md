It is such an oddity to see any rain in LA, then I get off the train and there
is this vivid rainbow.  We're waiting for the train to clear the station and
random people are coming up to me and saying, "hey, do you see the rainbow!"
 And then!  And then I see it is actually a double rainbow.  Hazah!
