Not only is it free.  Not only do you get the source code.  You also get
stability, more useful features, and portability across Linux/Mac/win.  It is
hard to beat the utter satisfaction of using a friendly featureful free
alternative to bloated buggy expensive commercial software.  Many of your
friends and colleagues may be stuck in the you-get-what-you-pay-for mindset and
missing out on this chance to save money and sanity, so spread the word when
opportunity presents.
