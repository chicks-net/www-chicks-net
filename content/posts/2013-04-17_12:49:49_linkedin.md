Arduino Hackathon at OpenX Pasadena Fri 26 April

Join the OpenX team in Pasadena for our first Arduino Hackathon!

Free food. Free Arduinos. Learn C. Learn to solder. Build something. Get prizes.

Please join us for an all-day hackathon where we’ll teach you how to use the Arduino including an introduction to electronics and C. Then, we will teach you how to solder, which is vital to building your own electronics. You can solder your own blinky pin and take it home to impress your family. Then we break into teams of 2-6 to build something to use in the real world. You’ll have lots of Arduino shields and electronic components to work with to build whatever you can imagine. Prizes will be awarded!

Use the meetup link to signup so I can make to get everyone fed.  :)
