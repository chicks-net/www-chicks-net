I walked past there on the way to FedEx last night.  I almost got more flan, but I showed restraint.  Screw restraint.

+James Hartshorn and I had another fine dinner at Mercado last night.  "If all flan tasted this good I would eat flan more often."  I propose sending all the people that make weak flan to the Mercado so they realize what the idea is.  :)
