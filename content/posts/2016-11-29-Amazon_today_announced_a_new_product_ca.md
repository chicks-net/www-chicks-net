Amazon today announced a new product called simply Product that will provide a
consistent API for them to create new products at the whim of product managers
without requiring any technical assistance or consistency with the laws of
physics.  With just a few clicks the dollars start pouring in.  The fees for
this can only be discussed under nondisclosure after you give them copies of
recent banks statements, but don't let that bother you.  It didn't concern the
computer press which faithfully reprinted their press release for Product as a
real article lauding Amazon as the geniuses behind the cloud.  [click]
