Endorsements are a good feature.  I'm always behind on writing recommendations
and this gives me an easy out for people that I haven't written a recommendation
for yet.  If you don't like this showing up on your profile you can hide that
section.  Hopefully linked-in will hear our concerns and improve this feature
further.  A lot of you seem to want to selectively delete individual endorsements.
I hope they don't waste their time on that.  All I want is a button that says
"never ask me to endorse person X again".
