I am so pleased to see that my favorite news weekly
([The Economist](https://www.economist.com/))
has decided to
[cover the icon of American journalism](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2024/09/02/the-onions-cutting-edge-paper)
we all know and love:
[The Onion](https://theonion.com/)!

The Ecoonomist and The Onion are probably in distinctly different categories in most people's minds.
The Onion is clearly satire and The Economist is clearly sober, serious news.
Right?  It is not so easy actually.

The Onion covers news with humor and does **not** limit itself to the facts.
Facts have become so much less fashionable in American politics lately,
so their choice probably won't prevent The Onion from continuing to
grow like a bean or prevent random publications from reprinting their articles as real news.
And then The Economist also covers the news.
The Economist **does** maintain factuality quite earnestly, but it isn't afraid
to poke fun at silly leadership or appreciate the humor readily apparent in
our crazy world.

In both cases, bringing humor into the story makes it much more fun to consider
events that are also scary or disturbing in some way.
Humor is an incredible antidote for many things, but it is particularly important
for bringing news stories that are larger than life into a scale that we can
fathom as mere individuals.
The Ecoonomist and The Onion are both incredible at bringing the humor and news together
in their own way.  Their writing is so great.

So you can see that it is perfect for The Ecoonomist to write an article about The Onion.
Now we can only hope that The Onion will be kind enough to return the favor.
It will be awesome.
