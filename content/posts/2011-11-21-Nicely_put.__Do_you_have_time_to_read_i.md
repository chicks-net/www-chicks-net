## The image says

Imagine there is a bank account that credits your account each morning with
$86,400. It carries over no balance from day to day. Every evening the bank
deletes whatever part of the balance you failed to use during the day. What
would you do? Draw out every cent, of course? Each of us has such a bank. Its
name is time. Every morning, it credits you with 86,400 seconds. Every night it
writes off as lost, whatever of this you have failed to invest to a good
purpose. It carries over no balance. It allows no over draft. Each day it opens
a new account for you. Each night it burns the remains of the day. If you fail
to use the day's deposits, the loss is yours. There is no drawing against
"tomorrow." You must live in the present on today's deposits. Invest it so as
to get from it the utmost in health, happiness and success. The clock is
running. Make the most of today.
