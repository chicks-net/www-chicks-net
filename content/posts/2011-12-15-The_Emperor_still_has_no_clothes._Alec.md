The Emperor still has no clothes.

Alec Baldwin may be an ass, but he was right when he protested cutting off his device.  There is no rational reason to cut them off.  If the plane can't survive personal electronics then let's hope it doesn't fly near a broadcast tower or during a solar flare.  And try to forget about the real holy grail, an EMP.  We have once again institutionalized Fear Uncertainty and Doubt.  Broadcast radio has been around for almost a century.  We've known about EMP's for 60 years.  We've had normal people flying with their personal electronics going on planes for 40 years.  And we accept that they haven't been able to do enough tests to ensure that we can let ordinary people fly with ordinary electronics doing their ordinary everyday things.  Why?

Wouldn't the plane be lighter, use less fuel, and be more profitable for the airline if people to brought Kindles instead of a few books?  Obviously we'll replace the weight with something else, but don't tell that to the airlines or the FAA.  Since they are happy to believe cargo cult science this won't be a problem.  :)
