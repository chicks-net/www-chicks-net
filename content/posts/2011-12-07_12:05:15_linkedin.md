Note: linked-in didn't give me any more than this so I'm not sure which article this was referencing now.

This is well written and entertaining.  But the author has focused on symptoms
and missed the fundamental problem which is that half of what gets said in this
business is BS from posers.  And the people that know it is BS just chuckle and
let it pass and the people that don't know it is BS are managers and choosing
where money goes.  Jargon is vital for communicating with each other, but it
should never be used with the muggles.  Don't say "Windows SLA depends on
regular antivirus, antimalware, and other updates and checks by an APLUS
technician."  Instead say, "Using Windows for real work requires a full-time
mechanic."  Everybody can understand that and decide accordingly.
