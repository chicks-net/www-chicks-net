Lots of good information in one place.

> Things you might not have known about City of Wonder! (Please share this with
> others, there seems to be many people who do not know this information. *This
> post has been made Public, so shares should work now.*)
>
> ### TL;DR
>
> 1. Ask for things or send things once a day. Refresh your notifications by
>    muting and refreshing your screen.
> 1. Ask for goods once a day. Reset timers by not asking for two days. See #1.
> 1. (UPDATED) We can accept only one building OR one legend, and one workshop
>    good per ally per day. See #1.
> 1. Mess halls are valuable. Sell them. See #1.
> 1. Certain bonuses can only be clicked once. Don't spam embassy bonuses or
>    expedition bonuses.
> 1. Hate "Too many goods" pop-ups? Put away your workshop!
> 1. (UPDATE) Gift timers appear to be based on the time the gift is sent, not when it is received!
>
> ### Details
>
> 1. NOTIFICATIONS WINDOW: The notifications window is (sort-of) fixed! Before
>    they fixed the problem, you could not go back beyond one page of requests
>    because the "More" button did not show any results. (it still doesn't!
>    lol) Well, now you can mute any post that you have fulfilled, and once you
>    have muted your entire page, you can refresh your tab and another page of
>    requests pops up! This means that you don't have to spam notifications or
>    requests, hoping that they stay on the first page long enough to get
>    clicks! You can send out a request once and know that people will be able
>    to get to it! Spamming requests only (a) frustrates you for not getting
>    the things you want, and (b) causes more unnecessary clicking for your
>    allies.
>
> 2. GOODS REQUESTS: After a lot of testing and discussion, we have come up
>    with a pretty good reasoning/solution to the workshop goods problem. We
>    believe that there is an internal City of Wonder timer that is started
>    when you receive an item from an ally that lasts 24 hours. Each ally has
>    their own timer, and there is no way of synchronizing them because people
>    click requests on their own time. Each ally can successfully gift you one
>    workshop item in a rolling 24-hour period. Sending out more than one
>    request per day is not beneficial and will actually hurt your workshop
>    numbers (see #1). It is even recommended that if you are having problems
>    getting items, you can reset everyone's timer by not requesting anything
>    for two days.
>
> 3. GIFTS (UPDATED!): Each ally is allowed to receive ONLY one building OR one
>    legend, and in addition one workshop request in a rolling 24-hour period!
>    The first gift that you send is the one that registers in the system. The
>    second gift returns an error screen. (Thanks +Rob Barnes!) Sending out
>    multiple gifts results in the same errors we are all used to seeing:
>    "Oops! Unfortunately, you cannot accept gifts at this time!" This also
>    ties in with #1 above.
>
> 4. GIFTS CAN BE SOLD: Each item in the game has a purchase price and a
>    selling price that is a fraction of the purchase price. Some items are
>    worth more than others. The Mess Halls that are currently in our options
>    to gift SELL for 20,000 coins each! This means that those who need an
>    economic boost can request Mess Halls and make hundreds of thousands of
>    coins very quickly! Great for starter cities and established cities!
>    Remember to build it before you sell it, each build grants you 200 XP!
>    Also remember to follow rule #1 for this as well.
>
> 5. BONUS REPETITION: Many people post every exploration bonus, thinking that
>    more bonuses equals more coins for our allies. Certain bonuses cannot be
>    collected more than once, and it seems that Playdom has tightened the grip
>    on this quite a bit. Here is a short list of what can be collected
>    repeatedly and what cannot:
>
>     - Embassy Expansion Bonus: Can only be collected once (post only one)
>
>     (EDIT: There seems to be a bug and certain bonuses can be recollected while
>     other times they can not. Further testing will be done to validate this
>     behavior.)
>
>     - Trade/Culture/War: Each can be collected once (post one of each)
>     - Assisting with Goods: One click per person (post the one you need the most)
>     - Assisting with Wonders: 30 per day regardless of who asks for it (post them all)
>     - (Note: unless is a multi-part wonder, in which case you can help in every phase, even if you have already helped 30 people!)
>     - Collecting Gifts: Unlimited, but repeat gifts will not be collected (post them all)
>     - Achievement Bonuses: Unlimited (post them all)
>
> 6. NO MORE GOODS POP-UPS!: (This one courtesy of +Chris Nichols ! Thanks!) I
>    know some of you have experienced this already. You go to collect your
>    5-minute goods, and get the annoying pop-up, "Too many goods!" Well, Chris
>    found out a really slick way of getting rid of those popups! Simply put
>    away your workshop prior to harvesting! You will not lose any goods
>    previously earned, you will not gain any more, and you can put your
>    workshop back down when you are done harvesting! Brilliant!
>
> 7. GOODS TIMER UPDATE!: It has been discovered that gifts can be repeatedly
>    collected from the same ally over and over as long as the time stamp for
>    each gift is past a rolling 24 hours! This was discovered when collecting
>    gifts sent to a temporarily inactive player. We were able to collect 30
>    Mess Halls from the same 5-6 people sending gifts! We believe the same
>    rule applies to Workshop goods, but this has not been confirmed.
