I hope Microsoft keeps burning through their pile of cash to buy dying companies like Nokia.  They should do BlackBerry in 2014 and then Apple in 2015.  Why not swallow IBM the next year?  Eventually Microsoft will go bankrupt and the only company maintaining a proprietary OS will be Oracle.  When Microsoft sells off the mouse and keyboard business you'll know the end is nigh.  You heard it here first!
