I can understand that Windows users don't have as much money to spend on books and games since they have to pay so much for their OS and apps.  Just the savings on anti-virus, firewall, and malware cleaners is enough to give Linux and Mac users a few hundred spare dollars per year to spend on fun or practical things.  I predict that all of this makes us happier and more productive people as well.
