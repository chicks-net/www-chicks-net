Here's some raw bullshit for your entertainment and outrage.  The article is utterly logically flawed.  But to address a few points...

I hate Sarah Palin because she spews lies with ease.

If Ann Romney should be a major factor in this election, why is she not running for an office?

Michelle Bachmann thinks Carbon Dioxide is a harmless gas.

Crazy happens in all parties and genders, but to be a prominant public Republican female seems to require it before signing up.
