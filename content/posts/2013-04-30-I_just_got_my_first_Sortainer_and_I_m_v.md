I just got my first Sortainer and I'm very pleased.  Now that I've watched this
video I've learned even more tricks it will do.  I haven't gotten any tools
from Festool yet, but they come highly recommended as well.

That guy had to spend tube amp money to get a wall of Festool containers.

Each of the containers behind that guy cost $75-$200.  So if you say they
average $100 a piece he has >$10,000 of Festool containers for the BACK-DROP.
