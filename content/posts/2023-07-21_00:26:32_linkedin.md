Repost of post by [David Kenny](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidkenny1/) from Nielsen:

> Today marks the 25th edition of The Gauge, an important industry snapshot of the total time U.S. viewers spend watching TV each month via broadcast, cable and streaming platforms.
>
> The Gauge is tracking, arguably, the most seismic shift in the history of television. In just 25 months, streaming has moved from representing 26% of total time spent with TV in the U.S. (cable was 39% and broadcast 25%) to today representing 37.7% of total time spent with TV in the U.S. (cable is now 30.6% and broadcast 20.8%).
>
> In 2021, we recognized five streaming platforms because they had reached at least 1% of TV usage (Netflix, YouTube, Hulu, Prime Video and Disney+).
>
> Today, there are 11 such streamers, including Max, Tubi, Peacock, Paramount+, Roku Channel and Pluto. The list continues to grow.
>
> Thereâ€™s no question streaming is the future of TV. Media companies are emphasizing it in their strategies, pure play streamers are continuing to make inroads, and, most importantly, consumers are voting with their remotes.
