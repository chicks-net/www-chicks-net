Yeah, I am learning that the hard way, some conversations just need to be avoided. The ones where nothing you can say will even be considered, because they are so dead set on their own point of view, everyone else is wrong >.<

Hmm i'm not in agreement with rule 2. If there is more than one valid argument then i think its fair to bring up all of them so they can be talked about, in fact that rule sounds more like the whole first box of 'This is not a discussion'
