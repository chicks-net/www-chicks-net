I think there's been entirely too much made of this, but I'm pleased the geeks
dug into this and pointed out the obvious problems.  I would like to note
that <https://mail.clintonemail.com/> takes you to the Outlook Web App backed by
Microsoft's Exchange.  Would somebody in the press please ask Hillary when she
plans to get support for her Outlook addiction?  It might be time for
intervention.
