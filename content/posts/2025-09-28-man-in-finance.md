## Artificial Intelligence

I had fun putting this together with Galaxy.AI.  It is amazing to me how easy
it was to get a result that I'm very satisfied with.

## Spreadsheets

I wanted to emphasize the spreadsheet angle from the beginning, but then the
generated videos weren't really that emphatically about spreadsheets.  So I
mulled whether to give up on the spreadsheet angle or rework the video, but
I ultimately settled on adding some educational links and mentioning it in
the description.
