## Artificial Intelligence

I had fun putting this together with Galaxy.AI.  It is amazing to me how easy
it was to get a result that I'm very satisfied with.

### Galaxy.AI

One of the reasons I went into so much detail about Galaxy.AI in my
[linked-in post about this](#linked-in-post) is that they were offering
a months worth of credits for writing a review.  I didn't have to pull
any punches, so I was happy to share how's it been working for me.

They also responded to my support ticket for the free credits really
quickly.  This encourages me to try to engage with them about some of
the rough spots I've encountered.  Of course I'm figuring that most of
my problems are still user error, but tech support may be able to show
me the way.

## Spreadsheets

I wanted to emphasize the spreadsheet angle from the beginning, but then the
generated videos weren't really that emphatically about spreadsheets.  So I
mulled whether to give up on the spreadsheet angle or rework the video, but
I ultimately settled on adding some educational links and mentioning it in
the description.

## Linked-in post

I've used AI to put together my first music video.  I've been thinking about
doing something like this for years, but it is amazing how good it ends up
being without the toil of learning new tools or other common hurdles.  It only
took a few iterations to go from idea to good result.

This was all done with Galaxy.AI, `ffmpeg`, `yt-dlp` and iMovie.

I've really enjoyed working with Galaxy.AI for various creative tasks.  It has
helped me write lyrics for a screenwriting project.  I've also had great fun
with their AI headshot tool.   I was able to take 7 random selfies and churned
out 130 interesting headshots in a huge variety of settings.

For this video project the biggest limitation with Galaxy.AI that I ran into
was only being able to process 90 seconds of audio into a music video at once.
One version ended up with realistic men in front of LEGO backgrounds, but I was
able to fix that with the part of the prompt that I have control over.

The whole project was great fun and I'm looking forward to working more with
these tools soon.

## Rebrickable Workbench

I also [shared this on my Rebrickable Workbench](https://rebrickable.com/users/chicks/workbench/33158/).

This is my latest LEGO-related creation.  I didn't post it on my
as-yet-to-launch LEGO channel since I'm really considering this more of
experimental art than definitely something i'd like to be part of my LEGO
channel.  I had fun making it and maybe we'll encourage a few people to learn
about spreadsheets.
