I suspect the combination is greater than the sum of its parts. :-P  Time for more science!

Wonder if there's an argument for me starting up again?!

Yes.  I think there's an argument for asking the government to educate people about the benefits and safest forms of consumption as a way to improve the health of Americans overall.  :)

I loved coffee, but hot chocolate is great with a chocolate croissant too.
