## My reaction to getting this posted

I'm so happy and relieved to have my first technical video on youtube.

There are a few things I wish I had included, particularly more on decorators
like OS and groups.  Yet the video is also longer than I was hoping for and
there's nothing I wish I had cut out.

I've pondered whether to edit out more of the mistakes to try to get a
"perfect speed run" for this presentation, but I hope that seeing a real
programmer making real typos and rolling with it is more entertaining
and realistic than somehow getting closer to perfection.

I'm very happy being able to share my
[presentation notes](https://github.com/chicks-net/presentation-notes/tree/main/just-intro)
and [the repo that was created in the video](https://github.com/chicks-net/just-demo3)
in the spirit of full disclosure.

It took about 20-30 hours over a month to pull this togther.  My colleagues at Tubi
have been fully supportive of me taking the time to do this and I hope this will be a
useful tutorial for my team and others.

I'm happy to share my first technical video on youtube. I've been using this cool command line tool
called "just" for the last few months and this is my way to introduce folks to it. I was surprised
to find that I was only the second youtube video about this tool. If you've got a few minutes,
please check it out.

Casey Rodarmor, the author of `just` posted a link on his twitter feed:

> Very nice! Just tweeted out the video: [tweet](https://x.com/rodarmor/status/1840856340450943480)

and he also noted

> The name of `just` used to be `j`, so searchability used to be even worse in the past ðŸ˜‚

which is hilarious and frightening at the same time.
