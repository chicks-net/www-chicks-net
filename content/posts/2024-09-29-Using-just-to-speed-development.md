I'm so happy and relieved to have my first technical video on youtube.

There are a few things I wish I had included, particularly more on decorators
like OS and groups.  Yet the video is also longer than I was hoping for and
there's nothing I wish I had cut out.

I've pondered whether to edit out more of the mistakes to try to get a
"perfect speed run" for this presentation, but I hope that seeing a real
programmer making real typos and rolling with it is more entertaining
and realistic than somehow getting closer to perfection.

I'm very happy being able to share my
[presentation notes](https://github.com/chicks-net/presentation-notes/tree/main/just-intro)
and [the repo that was created in the video](https://github.com/chicks-net/just-demo3)
in the spirit of full disclosure.

It took about 20-30 hours over a month to pull this togther.  My colleagues at Tubi
have been fully supportive of me taking the time to do this and I hope this will be a
useful tutorial for my team and others.
