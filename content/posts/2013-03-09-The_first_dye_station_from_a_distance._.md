Oh, run or dye!  Missed your previous post on it.Explain run or dye.  I'm envisioning a guy with a pyro-like dye gun chasing people, hosing the slowest :)

They had volunteers standing next to the path dousing people.  Some were using scoops, others had plastic bottles like a diner would use for ketchup and mustard.The problems were organization and breathing.  The organizers had 4 people for registration.  The line wrapped around the building.  We didn't get our official t-shirts until after we had walked the 5k.And then there was the breathing.  You really didn't want to stand down-wind of one of these dye stations.  The haze would choke a horse.  We bypassed some of the dye stations and were thus the cleanest people out there.  I don't mind getting dirty, but not being able to breath is very unpleasant.
