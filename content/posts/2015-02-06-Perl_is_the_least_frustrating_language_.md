Perl is the least frustrating language in the universe.  Here's the science.  Now why don't people spend more time with languages that make them happier?

I dunno... looking at the graphs on the page, PHP has more commits than Perl and significantly less anger. :) Just saying.Though looking at the max of commits and min of anger, looks like Ruby wins that trophy. This isn't to say any of the two languages I noted are better or worse in any way, just a commentary on the graphs. :)Side note, what's VIML? It seems to take the crown in most commits and least anger.

I was curious about VIML too.  It appears to be, much to my surprise, vim's scripting language.

Okay,  gotta take a closer look at that. Interesting.
