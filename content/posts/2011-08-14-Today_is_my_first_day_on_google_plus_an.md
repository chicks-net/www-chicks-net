Today is my first day on google plus and I have run into two frustrations.  The
most immediate and irritating issue is that when I try to type and make a post
in Safari it goes crazy like I'm typing lots of stuff I'm not.  I am typing
this is a local editor and I hope that I can cut and paste this in.  The other
big irritant is that I have a circle of people I don't want to follow, but they
show up by default.  Is it possible to make a circle of Negation?

I'm not having any problems in Safari. Nor did I have a big circle of default
people that I "had" to follow. Hmmmm. I find that if people are following me,
and I don't want to follow them, ignoring them by NOT putting them in any
circle does the trick. Then their posts don't show up in my stream.
