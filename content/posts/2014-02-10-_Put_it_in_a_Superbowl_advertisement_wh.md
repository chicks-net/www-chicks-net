"Put it in a Superbowl advertisement where the American National Anthem is being sung in Spanish and two men hold hands. Then people will notice,"   This is a good plan for informing the American public that our foreign aid is less than 1% of the Federal budget, but maybe we should use it for the larger goal of destroying the RNC/Fox fact-hating propaganda machine.  That way we can start dealing with the environment and the budget with fewer myths and more facts.
