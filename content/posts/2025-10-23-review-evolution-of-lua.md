## Introduction

I really enjoyed reading
[The evolution of Lua, continued](https://www.lua.org/doc/cola.pdf)
that I learned about thanks to this
[Hacker News thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45502502).
This is a great perspective on the long-term (15 year)
evolution of the Lua programming language.

While discussing language evolution is not completely unheard of, it is rather
atypical of the discussion we usually have around programming languages.  Most
often you're only concerned about the syntax or features of a particular
language version, usually the latest one.  Sometimes you might look at release
notes to see when a feature was introduced or a bug was fixed.  Our day to day
needs don't often benefit from a longer term perspective.

Now and then it is nice to step back and see how ideas work out and morph
to lead to the "final product" we are working with today.  The choices of a
programming language designer are something most programmers have considered
in some way.  Our tastes in languages - what we would use for our next project
and why - are a way of expressing opinions about what we'd like to see more of
from the designers and implementers of the languages.

[The evolution of Lua, continued](https://www.lua.org/doc/cola.pdf)
lets us get beyond our imaginations of what it must be like to hear how the
last 15 years have actually gone for the Lua developers.  What difficult
choices were made?  How did it work out years later?

## Specifics

It is fascinating that integers proved to be so challenging and revolutionary
for a programming language in recent memory.  I'm so impressed and grateful
at how the authors have walked us all through this journey with a healthy
dose of the concern and confusion they experienced along they way.

I had never heard of generational garbage collection before.  Now I have a
better understanding of it and I'm glad that it is working out well for Lua.

One of Lua's claims to fame was being the programming language for the
[World of Warcraft client](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lua).  This
was where I've spent the most time working with Lua.  It was a positive
experience so many years ago and it brought a spark of joy for that
to get mentioned as well.

## Community

The difficulties around LuaJIT made my sympathies go out to everyone
involved.  So much effort went into making such amazing things, but
sometimes communities don't get along and forking is the only solution.
This can lead to a naming challenge, but that's easier than getting
fractured communities back together.

As a long-time commentator on the free and open source communities I am proud
of the Lua community for reflecting on itself in such a thorough and honest
fashion.  Keeping a community together is a never-ending challenge.  Some
things will work, some things won't.  How you choose what to do from there
can have amazingly great or incredibly dismal consequences.  Whether you
agree with the Lua dev's choices, it is nice to learn what their
experience of going through the process was like.

## Conclusion

With the [RubyGems drama](https://lwn.net/Articles/1040778/) and bewildering
lawfare in the Wordpress community in our recent memories, it is heartwarming
to see a counter example.  Some communities are surviving and thriving over
decades.  The free software and open source movements are not over since
some corporate overlords have pulled another bait and switch.  The community
not only remains vigilant to not rewarding bad actors, but new and interesting
software continues to come out every day.

## Meta

I didn't finish anything that I
[meant to finish this month](https://github.com/chicks-net/www-chicks-net/blob/main/TODO.md).
I am happy to be writing more actively and consistently than in years past.
The schedule was a nice idea, but I'm not too invested in it.

## Linked-in post

TODO: it should go live on Monday.
