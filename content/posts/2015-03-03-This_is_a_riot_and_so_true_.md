Lol, but the analogy isn't quite apt.

Sure it is.  People worry that I don't have enough Rails experience when I had ZERO erlang experience before managing hundreds of erlang boxen.  And I'm still years from reading or writing erlang.  RECRUITER: "Can you work with Ruby?"ME: "I'm an ops guy!  Your product could be written in COBOL and it barely changes my job."RECRUITER:  "We really want someone with more experience in Ruby."ME: "But I won't be reading or writing Ruby as part of my job according to your job description.."RECRUITER: "The programmers won't be able to talk to you unless you speak their language."  ME: "Alrighty then, good luck with that."But then later it gets better.HiIRING MANAGER: "We've been through thousands of resumes and dozens of interviews without finding a candidate.  What can we do better?"RECRUITER: "It is a tough market out there.  You just have to keep at it."HM: "Should we change our job description requirements to bring in more candidates?RECRUITER: "If we relax our expectations we will be flooded with so many applicants we can't handle it."HM: "But how can somebody have 5 years experience with a product that has only been out 1 year?"RECRUITER: "For the best candidates that should not be a problem."HM: "OK then, where's the next stack of resumes?"In my screenplay version of this the recruiter doesn't respond logically at the end.  She shoots the Hiring Manager so he doesn't spread the word that unicorn hunts are boring and not fun.  Then she calls the HR mafia who come sweeping in to disappear the body.  But I kept it closer to the analogy for this discussion.
