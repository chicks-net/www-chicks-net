## Introduction

Like many, I’ve usually kept my charitable giving private — and I’ve respected
that choice in others.  But recently, a few people have asked where they might
consider donating. Since I don’t see a need to keep it to myself, I’ll share my
recommendations for anyone interested.

I’ve organized this around a few themes.  For each one I will link to the
organization’s website and the Charity Navigator rating.  For all of the
organizations mentioned below, I respect them and I have personally donated to
them at least once, but often over several years.  I’m leaving out
organizations that I don’t want to donate to for various reasons and local
charities, but I may revisit those topics someday.  I’m also not including much
commentary on each one since I’m hoping you will find your own reasons to like
them and contribute.

## Human Rights

- Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC)
  - [http://www.splcenter.org](http://www.splcenter.org)
  - [https://www.charitynavigator.org/ein/630598743](https://www.charitynavigator.org/ein/630598743)
    scores 99
  - They’ve had a few controversies in recent years, but they continue to
    contribute by identifying hate groups and engaging in the courts.
- Amnesty International
  - [https://www.amnestyusa.org/](https://www.amnestyusa.org/)
  - [https://www.charitynavigator.org/ein/520851555](https://www.charitynavigator.org/ein/520851555)
    scores 96

## Ukraine

- United24
  - [https://u24.gov.ua/](https://u24.gov.ua/)
  - The official donation arm for the Ukrainian government, but they are not
    registered as an IRS charity so Charity Navigator is not interested in
    including them in their ratings.  It also means that you can’t take it off
    of your taxes.
- Nova Ukraine
  - [https://novaukraine.org/](https://novaukraine.org/)
  - [https://www.charitynavigator.org/ein/465335435](https://www.charitynavigator.org/ein/465335435)
    scores 100 \- their best score for a Ukraine charity

## Technology

- Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)
  - [https://www.eff.org](https://www.eff.org)
  - [https://www.charitynavigator.org/ein/043091431](https://www.charitynavigator.org/ein/043091431)
    scores 100
- The Linux Foundation
  - [https://www.linuxfoundation.org/](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/)
  - [https://www.charitynavigator.org/ein/460503801](https://www.charitynavigator.org/ein/460503801)
    does not get a rating since it is a 501c6 instead of a 501c3 organization.

## Trains

There are an amazing number of train-related NGOs.  I’m going to list a few
that I’ve encountered and loved, but I’m sure you can find some in your
neighborhood as well.

- Niles Canyon Railway and The Pacific Locomotive Association, Inc.
  - [https://www.ncry.org/](https://www.ncry.org/)
  - [https://www.charitynavigator.org/ein/946130878](https://www.charitynavigator.org/ein/946130878)

## Games

## Charity Desert

I have used my searching talent in Google and Charity Navigator to try to find
a charity that is focused on single-payer health insurance.  When we have
health insurance CEOs getting murdered on city streets, why isn’t there a
charity advocating for a different system?  Has the insurance industry managed
to suppress all opposition or am I missing something?  If you have an answer,
please reach out.

## Conclusion

I hope this will give you some ideas of good places to donate on a regular
basis to encourage the world to be as good as it can be.
