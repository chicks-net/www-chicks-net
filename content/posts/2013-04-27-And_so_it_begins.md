We still haven't cracked the plastic on Power Grid, but playing Munchkin, Cards Against Humanity, and Arkham Horror all in one evening is not too shabby.  I ended up napping through the last hour of Arkham, but they say they beat it.  The only thing that was suspicious was that the game was all packed up when I awoke.  ;)  Thanks to +Todd Stein +Paul Fernandez and +Scott Johnson for an awesome Saturday.
