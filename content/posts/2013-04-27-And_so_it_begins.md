We still haven't cracked the plastic on Power Grid, but playing Munchkin, Cards
Against Humanity, and Arkham Horror all in one evening is not too shabby.  I
ended up napping through the last hour of Arkham, but they say they beat it.
 The only thing that was suspicious was that the game was all packed up when I
awoke.  ;)  Thanks to + [Todd

Saturday.
