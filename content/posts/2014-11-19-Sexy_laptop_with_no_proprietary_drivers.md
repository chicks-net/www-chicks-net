It... it looks like a macbook air with the trackpad off to the side a bit. And a full qwerty keyboard squished in place. What's the pricepoint?

$2000 +- $200 is their MSRP and if you get in on the campaign you can have it for $1550 +- $150.  It definitely looks like a MacBook but without proprietary bits inside. :-)  And it might even be cheaper than a MacBook Pro.

Hmm... interesting concept. A part of me would prefer to wait and see how it goes. I've been thinking of trying to build my own little custom computer... but already have too many mini projects on my todo list. ^_^;;

I wish them well, but I'm going to let other people be the early adopters on this one.  I'm about to upgrade my brick-like HP laptop to +Linux Mint 17.  After that I'm much more interested in getting some fanless Atom servers and building a small cluster.  The list is long.  :notebook_with_decorative_cover:
