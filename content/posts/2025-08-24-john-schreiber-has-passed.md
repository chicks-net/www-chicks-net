I edited [The Life of John Schreiber](https://tinyurl.com/JohnSchreiber)
in iMovie on a MacBook Air (M2 2022).  The family contributed around 400
photos which turned out to be closer to 250 after deduping and various 
other objections.  I also relied heavily on Handbrake for converting
videos into a format that iMovie will accept and MacOS Preview made the
basic photo editing a breeze.
