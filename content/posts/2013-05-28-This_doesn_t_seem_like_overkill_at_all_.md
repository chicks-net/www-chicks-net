This doesn't seem like overkill at all.  Millions of euros are being lost!  This is so heinous I wonder why they stop at drones.  Why not fire an EMP blast at the miscreants to fry their cell phones?  That would teach 'em.  Or drop tear gas?  Maybe that's too old school.  Here's the plan: identify the kids and robocall their mothers with a list of the crimes their offspring have recently committed.  That's the way to save money here.  If the Germans don't get on top of this we'll think they're as wasteful as the Greeks.

I say we just get rid of all walls.  Better solution.
