The solution to American schools is to focus on equity and kick out the private sector.  Pass it on.

## Originally shared by Raven Amos

Back in high school, I was involved briefly in the 3D demo scene with a young
man I remember only by his nickname, Kit.  We would drive to Anchorage to work
with our team on a project that we wanted to enter in a competition held in
Helsinki, Finland.  Kit was elected to be our ambassador, and after receiving a
single email saying he was okay and everything was going well, I never heard
from him again.  He was still attending school and never understood why he
didn't come back.

After reading this article, 14 years later, I think I understand why.
