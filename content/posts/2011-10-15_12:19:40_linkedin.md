I got to play a small but fun part in OpenX opening up a new data center in less
than 60 days.  From not knowing the people to serving production traffic
including structured network wiring, cage buildout, rack construction and
shipping, and all of the other "little things".  Apparently it takes most people
3 times this long.  What are they spending their time doing?  :)
