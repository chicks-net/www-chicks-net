Executive summary: Perl is awesome, Java sucks, and there are also some other
programming languages.   This certainly fits with my experiences.  They've been
a bit more scientific and pedantic.  Enjoy.

As a Perl lover, this is great.  As a skeptic, I wonder if this is all on the
level.  He seems to have pro-Perl/anti-Java bias...Chicks, did you write this?

+Paul Fernandez : I understand your concern.  Java's reputation has strongly
benefited from a well-oiled hype machine so it is uncomfortable when that pig
is so easily gored.  I don't think any of that is a surprise to anyone that has
used Java outside the classroom.The other languages get a fair shake.  LUA is
not aimed at solving these sorts of problems so the results make sense.  Python
did better than I expected in performance, but considering the way he defined
his benchmark he's not using many of pythons sexy slow features so I can
believe that part.  Of course PHP is shit.  I hadn't heard of magic quotes
before.  That's exactly the sort of short-sited ill-conceived thinking that
I've bitched about from the PHP/FI community. Then there's Perl.  People have
been unfairly beating it down for speed since the beginning.  How could a bunch
of interpreted code run fast?  Well, that's parsed and thrown out in the first
millisecond.  Afterward you've got the core Perl event loop executing tokens.
 Those tokens are like an assembly language that provides cool features like a
regex engine that is shockingly efficient.  And they've been optimizing Perl5
for over a decade.  Features show up too, but there has been a lot of
debugging, optimization, trying it out and letting that feed back into the
process.  The result is shocking: your Perl code runs faster than equivalent C
code.  Of course you could write your C code with all of the crazy
optimizations that are already built into Perl.  But I'd rather not reinvent
the wheel so I code mostly in Perl.And I did not write it.  You can prove that
by word usage patterns. You have plenty of what I've written publicly and
privately to make a corpus.  :)  I with the guy had edited it more thoroughly.
 I'm tempted to redo it myself and include more obscure languages.  I'll post
it here if I do!
