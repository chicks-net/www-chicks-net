My favorite paragraph: << And TerribleTony told us of his incredibly intriguing product: "I'm working on a 36-core SoC design. 16 of the cores are 6510's, 10 ten are Z80's, two are Hercules Graphics Adapters, two are FM synthesizers I pulled off of old SoundBlaster Pro or Adlib cards (whatever I could find at Goodwill), three are 8088s, and the remaining three are actually people doing jobs it offloads to Amazon's Mechanical Turk." >>  I'm ready to run benchmarks when there is silicon!
