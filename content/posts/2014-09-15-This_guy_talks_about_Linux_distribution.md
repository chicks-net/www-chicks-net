This guy talks about Linux distributions for 13 paragraphs without mentioning
package formats or using your desktop to develop for the server.  He's trying
to push for splitting server and desktop distros without mentioning CoreOS.
Could this be why folks accuse him of not using Linux?   Maybe he talked to
some actual Linux users, but ignored what they said and wrote what he felt like
writing.  Maybe he thinks Linux is controlled by some big corp and that this
whining will get things done.  Maybe they're so desperate to print Linux
articles it doesn't matter if they're clearly written by somebody who uses some
other OS to get their work done.

Hey +InfoWorld, if you'd prefer to look like you know what you're doing rather
than spewing sordid sensationalism, hire me as an editor.
