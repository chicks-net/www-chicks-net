So, do you want to cry about phantom floppy drives messages or fight viruses
and malware?  I'm not going to pretend that the Linux desktop is free of bugs
or that every Windows app has an great equivalent in Linux.  But installing
Linux is often easier than installing Windows on the same hardware.  Linux
includes nearly all of the device drivers you will ever need.  And I don't have
to fear the inevitable Windows spiral of death from malware, viruses, and
bloat.  So, do you want to cry about phantom floppy drives messages or fight
viruses and malware for the rest of your life?   Hmmmm.
