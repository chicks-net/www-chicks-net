Check out the ties I wore in July 2024.

Through various means I have ended up with an extensive collection of ties.
I haven't counted them, but someday I might.  I'm guessing I've got
a hundred neckties or so.
One of the traditions I took up a few years before Covid struck was to wear a
tie and sports coat to work every day when I was going into the office.  I've
been known to carry this motif into virtual meetings now and then.  It has
been fun and led to lots of good conversations and interactions.

With the last few years of work-from-home happiness this tradition has fallen
by the wayside.  I've even started packing up most of the ties since it will
be very rare for me to get around to wearing them these days.

So it was quite the sentimental experience to get to wear so many ties this
month relative to the average for the last few years.  One reason for this
was holding Observability Office Hours in the San Francisco office for
[Tubi](https://tubitv.com/)
every Tuesday in July.  We built on this by spending a fun weekend in the
city.

If you're spending a weekend in the city, that's a lot of good excuses for
getting dressed up and so that used up a few ties.  One event that I'm
particularly proud of overdressing for was the
[Empire Strips Back](https://theempirestripsback.com/) -
"A Star Wars Burlesque Parody"!  The whole thing was so very well done.
The costumes were incredible.  The sets were awesome.  Of course, the dancing
was mesmerizing.  The crowd at the
[Great Star Theater](https://www.greatstartheater.org/)
was happy to be there and totally positive.  The question of plot has come up
in several conversations.  I can testify that there is minimal plot and the
connections between scenes are tenuous at best.  If that sort of thing bothers
you, I don't know what to tell you.  Otherwise, you might have a good time.

Another highlight of our weekend in the city was eating at
[Prubechu](https://www.prubechu.com/).
They serve cuisine from Guam.  I've never known for such a type of
restaurant to exist, but I'm really glad we found.  It was conveniently
only a few blocks from the Mission Dolores Basilica.  The food was amazing.
We're not in this area that often, but we'll definitely try to squeeze in
a meal here when we do.
