For all of us that made fun of Richard Stallman and other free software zealots, it is time for reflection.  Is open source going to take a stand against overzealous government spies?  Maybe hanging out with people that talk about freedom on a regular basis and act on that belief is a good idea after all.  Is commercial software going to save us from the Global War on Terrorism?  Maybe it is time to put time and earnest effort into our technological future instead of expecting to buy it at 7-11 for $9.99.

But with news like this there are questions beyond the politics of technology.  Does the ACLU still look like a bunch of paranoid radicals?  Maybe they've been right all along.   Are our political parties going to represent us well here?  Maybe it is time to support a third party and their candidates.  Does our form of government function effectively in the digital age?  Maybe Jefferson was right that we need to revisit government periodically.  If Jefferson's suggestion of rewriting the constitution every generation is wise and effective, we've skipped nine opportunities for self-improvement as a nation.  Since we're #1 in military, prisons, and consumerism what should we improve anyway?

Few people that understand technology are surprised that it is being applied in this way by our government.  And if the silent majority stays happy letting other people take a stand we'll be in the safest prison cell we can make for ourselves.  What are you going to do about it?
