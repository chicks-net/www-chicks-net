Once again the forces for copyright have reduced the rights of normal people who have done nothing wrong.  Any chance of a lost nickle is too much for the copyright advocates.  And they get to demand these rights for life+70 years.  That's no good for the public domain, but that's an easy to ignore consequence if they can be $20 richer in the 145th year of publication.

As China has amply demonstrated if you want to remain relevant to manufacturing you need a very different view of intellectual property.  But don't worry, for trading away making cars, washing machines, and almost everything else we got Hollywood and stock photo houses.  Those are the best people to optimize our economy for it would seem.  I'm sure Hollywood is excited to retrain coal and factory workers to be the next Dwayne The Rock Johnson.
