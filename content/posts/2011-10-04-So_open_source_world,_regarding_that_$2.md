I feel I have given a few dollars since then and I have a few more to give.

It is strange and neat to be looking back on this after 14 years, during a year
where I have ramped up my rate and quality of contributions to the free
software and open source communities.

What will I contribute in the next 14 years?  Noone knows for sure!
