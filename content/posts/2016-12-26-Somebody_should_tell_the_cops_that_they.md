Somebody should tell the cops that they were hired to protect our freedoms like Freedom of Speech and that trying to suppress those freedoms creates more distrust.  Actively trying to thwart Freedom of Speech by pushing an agenda of sensitivity is really funny from folks who seem to use intimidation as their default for interaction with The People.  Maybe the FOP should push for better accountability around police shootings so that everybody can have the facts.  But, no, they're writing passionate letters that people wearing t-shirts they don't agree with is making it hard for them to come to work.  Maybe if they got some therapy they could realize that dead black kids in the streets is a hell of a lot more significant than what t-shirts anybody is wearing to the mall.
