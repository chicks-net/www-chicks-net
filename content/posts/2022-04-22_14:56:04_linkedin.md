I keep getting these emails from linked-in and I can't help but wonder: why are
you neglecting your website that much?  Why is the app that much better?  Is it
really better?  They don't make it apparent how.  Do they not care about people
using the web version anymore?   Does Microsoft really feel the primary audience
is mobile and not people that sit in front of their computers all day?  Why
should we believe that linked-in is going to continue investing in the app when
we've seen folks like StackOverflow create apps and then abandon them?
