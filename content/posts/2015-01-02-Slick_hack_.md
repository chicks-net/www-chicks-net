This is what I see myself doing when I go for my BSEE.  I was mainly planning on pranking my Java profs, but the opportunities for subtlety in electronics are encouraging.The fact that the professor completely missed it makes is so much funnier for me.

When I took my digital electronics course at MVCC, our professor was a practical joker.  So if we were to hand something like this in, he'd actually give us extra credit.
