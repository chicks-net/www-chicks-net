I read a few passages from this book while doing background research on "five nines" reliability.  This led me to find that the print book is now $200-$300 which is particularly ironic considering the book's title.  

An even bigger curiosity is: has this book has any real impact?  Are we moving to a more distributed model of power generation?  The recent announcement of bulk solar installations on military base housing seems like a move in this direction.  Has there been a real change in direction?  It seems like the big guys are still trying to build more megaplants, but maybe the real action is projects that get little notice.
