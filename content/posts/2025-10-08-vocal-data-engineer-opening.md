Is anyone in my network looking for work these days?

One of our family members works at [Vocal Media](https://vocal-media.io/).
They've been very happy with their role, so I hope this [Senior Software Engineer
role](https://jobs.lever.co/get-vocal-pbc/24b07caf-cc0a-429f-a90d-f5e92583752d)
could be worth your time to check out. It sounds focused on the data warehouse
from the job description. So you don't have to worry about me competing with
you.

Feel free to comment on this post or DM me if you're actively looking for
something now.
