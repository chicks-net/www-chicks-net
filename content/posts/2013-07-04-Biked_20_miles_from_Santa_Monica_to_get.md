Pics of bike?  I'm cross that I was not consulted in this purchase!  You know
how much I like helping people spend their money! :)

I also ignored the advice of several folks that told me to go to craiglist.  I
went with a hybrid from REI.  They adjusted a few things before my second day
of riding and now I'm up to ~70 miles on the new bike since Wednesday when I
bought it.  Bru-hahahaha.  Pictures have been taken and will be uploaded.  I've
got 600 pics from the new camera to sift through.I don't feel like I'm trapped
in Santa Monica now that I can get to the light rail.  I made it all the way to
Barnaby's Wednesday night by bike/train/bike.  To get to Costa Mesa I punted
for the last 10 miles so it ended up being bike/train/bike/taxi.  I rode the
Green Line for the first and probably last time.  :)

That's impressive!  You're one guy I know will put his bike to good use :D When
you say hybrid, I assume you mean it has an electric motor.  Is that right?Have
you considered something like Adobe Lightroom for image sorting and processing?
 I've used it for ages.  It's good.

Thanks!  The idea of going to the gym doesn't work for me.  I want to exercise
and get somewhere I need to go or something like that.  I'm still trying to get
used to the idea that I'm "fit".  I'm playing with a fitbit too.
