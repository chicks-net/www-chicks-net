San Francisco from the Fairmont Hotel.  The view of the Coit Tower was also
excellent.  The whole day before this had been rainy and dreary so it was
stunning that the sun came out so quickly.

Which camera are you using, again?  Samsung, right?

That was taken with my Samsung S4 phone.  I haven't been playing with the
NX1000 since I've been in Oakland.

Whaaaa?!  That makes it even more impressive! :)

I'm shocked you're not rocking a Nexus 5 phone.

My t-mobile phone is the + [Nexus
4](https://plus.google.com/100197618630018170541) which is fabulous.  But I
might get a Nexus 5 for Christmas.  Hopefully Verizon will relax their locking
policies soon so I can get the Nexus Experience on my S4.
