This seems very reasonable and I hope this idea catches on in other places.
Other options that come to mind would be more onerous and less likely to be adhered to.

Additional beneficial side effects of this will be for all network games to be
more fault tolerant to network problems and for EOL considerations to get more
thought and testing during development.
