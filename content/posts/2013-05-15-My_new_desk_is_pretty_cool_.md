That is SO badass!

Where are you working, exactly?  Geographically, I mean.

My hotel and office are on the same block so I can walk either way out of the
hotel, cross zero streets, and arrive at the office.  Bru-hahahaha!

What?!  That's not allowed!

Have you already turned in the keys for your apartment?

I'm staying in Highland Park on the weekends.

Still no solid farewell date?  I want to make sure I don't miss the party :)

We did minigolf.   This Saturday anyone can join me for the pricey train
ride:  <http://www.meetup.com/Outdoor-Singles/events/118858872/>

The next weekend is a maker weekend at the cabin up in Arnold.  I'm trying to
arrange a potluck for Sun 2 Jun.  Natalie may plan something too.

I don't know how long I will be in the US after that.  My passport is complete
and we're working on my work permit now.
