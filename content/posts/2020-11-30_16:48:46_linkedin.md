First, [The Economist](https://www.economist.com/business/2020/11/12/takeaways-from-mcdonalds-remarkable-comeback)
covers my new job in the first month.  Now, we have
[Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/mcdonalds-drive-thru-mymcdonalds-app/) .
covering this as well.  That's my two favorite magazines of all time.  I'm not
sure how the
[Smithsonian's Air & Space](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/category/air-space-magazine/)
or [Make](https://makezine.com/) will get in on this, but either could be the hat trick!
